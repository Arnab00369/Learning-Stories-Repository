ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** JAVA,C,C++,Python, GitHub, Markdown, JS and so on 

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025 though new to this open-source contribution but learning. Firstly, I thought I should be a proper and expert coder to be able to contribute but after getting knowledge about it I learned that it is pretty simple. But, then I discovered some repos and all relevant things to contribute to.  

My First PR was a Code Files Repository where I added some codes of Python which I used in my other repos as well while learning Python.




ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Do not start late, start steady learning while in the journey i the most important part ðŸš€
